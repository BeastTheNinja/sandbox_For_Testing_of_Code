    <main>
       <h2>numbers</h2>
        <p>This is the original array:</p>
        <code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code>
        <p>It contains the numbers 1 through 5.</p>

        <h2>reversed</h2>
        <p>This array is created by calling numbers.reverse().</p>
        <p>The reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in the array in place.</p>
        <p>After this, numbers itself is now [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and reversed points to the same array (since reverse() mutates the original array and returns it).</p>
        <h2>filtered</h2>
        <p>This array is created by calling numbers.filter(num => num > 2).</p>
        <p>the parameter num => num > 2 is an arrow function. For each element in the numbers array, num represents the current value. The function returns true if num is greater than 2, and false otherwise. Only elements for which the function returns true are included in the filtered array.</p>
        <p>The filter() method creates a new array containing only elements that pass the test (num > 2).</p>
        <p>Since numbers is now [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] (already reversed), filtered will be [5, 4, 3] (all numbers greater than 2).</p>
        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>
        numbers starts as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but is reversed to [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
        reversed is the same as the reversed numbers array.
        filtered contains only the values from the reversed array that are greater than 2: [5, 4, 3].
